1. vmdk

2. grub

3. boot command 
   boot from HD and net install. There are /vmlinuz and /initrd.img in HD.
   ------------------------
   root (hd0,0)
   kernel /vmlinuz root=live:http://.../LiveOS/squashfs.img append ip=dhcp inst.ks=http://.../ks.cfg inst.repo=http://... 
   initrd /${new_initrd}
   ------------------------
   a. make sure LiveOS, ks and repo is accessable. 
      Do NOT use ksdevice=eth0. Interface name isn't eth0, since centos7 enables Predictable Network Interface. 
   b. If use initrd.img instead of squashfs.img, there are many strang errors such as multipath, ext4, iscsi.
      It looks like that installation failed to start and the normal boot process started (boot from HD).

4. install CA
   a. Run the 2 steps in
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37043442/how-to-add-certificate-authority-in-centos7
   b. If the CA is not added to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt. 
   $ openssl verify <theCA.pem> 
   c. compare the error with that in
   https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Certificate_errors
   For 'error 9 at 0 depth lookup:certificate is not yet valid', my fix is to adjust timezone to UTC
